starting..

6.6.12: 
- created empty example with project generator.
- removed video in ofMain,include and lib dir(video, videoInput, quicktime) 
- commented #include "ofQtUtils.h" and "closeQuicktime" in ofExitCallback from ofAppRunner 

-> runs without video in 32 bits.

- moved to 64
- commented method fixCloseWindowOnWin32 because of error "..\..\..\openFrameworks\app\ofAppGlutWindow.cpp(178): error C2065: 'GWL_WNDPROC' : undeclared identifier"
- got 4287432704 bytes; 3.99298 Gigabytes testing in main. with all OF coded of the appgui commented. Just to be sure the project was gonna assign aroud 4 Gb.

STEP BY STEP solving link problems:

- compiling poco (release static md) foundation,net,util,xml. (poco located in my download folder) -> unresolved external symbol link problem gone
- compiled glut (located in the FL common folder)  -> unresolved external symbol link problem gone
- glew 1.7.0 win64 downloaded on http://glew.sourceforge.net/ -> unresolved external symbol link problem gone
- cairo 1.10.2 downloaded on http://www.gtk.org/download/win64.php. Renamed library cairo as it was previously for 32, that is cairo-static -> unresolved external symbol link problem gone
- FreeImage (copied from previous attempts of getting OF under 64 bits) -> unresolved external symbol link problem gone
- copied C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Lib\x64\GLU32 in OF -> unresolved external symbol link problem gone
- looks like a pain finding tess.. jumping to next library
- copied files fmodex64_vc and fmodexL64_vc from C:\Program Files (x86)\FMOD SoundSystem\FMOD Programmers API Windows\api\lib and renamed them without the 64.
Probably downloaded at some point the fmodex programmers api from http://www.fmod.org/fmod-downloads.html
misses the fmodexp_vc.. but -> unresolved external symbol link problem gone for now..
- did not directly found tess2.. moved out from OF for now:

removed ofTessellator*
in ofPath.h commented "#include "ofTessellator.h" and "static ofTessellator tessellator;"
in ofPath.cpp commented "ofTessellator ofPath::tessellator;" and the method "tessellate"

- compiles and links correctly. but application does not start. No wonder.. did not yet put right dlls.
(the application was unable to start correctly 0xc00007b)

- copied files fmodex64.dll and fmodexL64.dll from C:\Program Files (x86)\FMOD SoundSystem\FMOD Programmers API Windows\api and renamed them without the 64 in the bin folder.
- FreeImage.dll from http://www.sambeauvois.be/blog/2010/05/freeimage-and-x64-projects-yes-you-can/ (at the bottom there is a link to the FreeImageX64zip file)
- glut32.dll from http://www.idfun.de/glut64/ renamed glut64.dll to glut32.dll

The rest of the dll left for now:
- Assinm32.dll
- FreeType-6.dll
- Zlib.dll 

-> for now empty example work with load/draw image and show transparent rectangles...
